# MongoDB findOne() Returning Null Despite Matching Document

This repository demonstrates a common issue where MongoDB's `findOne()` method unexpectedly returns `null` even when a matching document should exist.  The provided code exhibits the problem and a proposed solution.

## Problem
The original JavaScript code uses `findOne()` to query a MongoDB collection. Although a matching document exists, the query incorrectly returns `null`, leading to the wrong output message.

## Solution
The solution addresses this issue by carefully handling potential errors and examining the query and data to correctly identify and retrieve the intended document.  It demonstrates best practices for querying MongoDB and handling potential issues.
